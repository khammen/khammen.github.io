        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
        This is my last semester to finish up my CS degree with a concentration in AI and Robotics. I'm also an applied clarinet music minor! <br>
        When I'm not in class, I enjoy hiking, learning new musical instruments, reading, and playing games. 
        </p>
        <p>Fun fact: Me, my grandfather, and his grandfather all share the same birthday.</p>
        <p>Things I'm looking forward to learning in this class:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How to better style with CSS</li>
            <li>Basic and advanced princpiples of web design and development</li>
            <li>Learning the limits of what can be done with websites</li>
        </ul>
