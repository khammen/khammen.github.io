            <p>I didn't actually set out to study Computer Science in college - in fact, I didn't
                write a single line of code until my sophomore year, when I took the intro-level class
                on a whim! Luckily for me I did, as I was immediately hooked. I love the ability to take
                a complex problem, decompose it into approachable elements, and construct a logic-based solution.
                I think modern computational problem-solving developments in the fieds of AI and Machine Learning
                are fascinating, and I can't wait to study their creation and application more in grad school.
                (Though of course, I think building software is just as fun.)<br><br>
                When I'm not learning new things about CS, I can often be found at the music buildings
                on campus! I'm a skilled clarinetist, and also play a variety of other instruments on the side.
