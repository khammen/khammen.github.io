    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      This is my last semester to finish up my CS degree with a concentration in AI and Robotics. I'm also an applied clarinet music minor! <br>
      When I'm not in class, I enjoy hiking, learning new instruments, reading, and playing games. 
    </p>
    <p>Fun fact: Me, my grandfather, and his grandfather all share the same birthday.</p>
    <p>Things I'm looking forward to learning in this class:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How to better style with CSS</li>
      <li>Basic and advanced princpiples of web design and development</li>
      <li>Learning the limits of what can be done with websites</li>
    </ul>
