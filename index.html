            <!--Needs breaking up, but here's what I plan on saying-->
            <p>My name's Kurt Hammen, and I'm a senior Computer Science Major at the University of Delaware.
                Once this semester finishes, I'll be continuing my education in a master's/PhD program
                researching applications of artifical intelligence to modern infrastructure.<br><br>
                
                Once that wraps up, I plan on entering the tech industry and using what I've learned
                to develop software solutions for modern problems. You can learn more about me by
                checking out my resume here, or by scrolling down and seeing my past and upcoming projects!

                        My first introduction to web development was in CISC275, where the final project 
                        was to build <a href="https://ud-cisc275-f21.github.io/ud-cis-scheduler-team-4/" target="_blank">a course-scheduling site</a>
                        for CISC majors using React and Typescript. I was lucky to have a great group who I learned a lot from! Looking 
                        back on it now, there's certainly some changes I'd make and bugs that need fixing, but it was a great introductory 
                        experience that exposed me to the basic ideas of web development. <br><br>

                        This past spring, I took an introduction to robotics course, where we used a 
                        Roomba-esque robot and the ROS2 software for robot programming! We created a variety 
                        of programs for the robot using a variety of sensors, ranging from simple wall-following
                        using the bumper and LIDAR, to a more advanced soccer-playing program that utilized 
                        camera vision and the cv2 library for image processing and required more complex logic.
                        These were collaborative team projects, and you can check out the code on my github 
                        (Or, you can check out just the soccer project <a href="https://github.com/amanikiruga/soccer-ros2" target="_blank">here</a>).

                        CISC498/499 are a pair of consecutive courses referred to as our "capstones", where we work together in a team to
                        build a project requested by an outside source. In our case, my team partnered with a graduate student in the 
                        biology department in order to build a <a href="cisc-capstone-teams.pages.eecis.udel.edu/cisc498-22f/team-15/team15/" target="_blank">website</a> 
                        to display experimental data. It was challenging creating a system to handle and represent large datasets that may
                        not share a common structure.

                    Web Technologies has been a great learning experience so far, and has really enhanced my understanding of web development
                    at a more basic and fundamental than CISC275 taught me. We're now using what we've learned to create a 
                    <a href="https://shay97279.github.io/CISC474TermProject/" target="_blank">financial tracking site</a>, which is still in its 
                    early stages but coming along. Our vision is to create a web tool with which users can track and visualize in detail their
                    income, expenses, and assets, and use this information to create long-term savings projections and establish short-term 
                    financial goals. Check back in early next year to see the finished version!

                    <b>Absolution Randomizer</b><br>
                    This is a randomizer for the game Absolution, a fangame inspired by Nintendo's Fire Emblem series. I'm not the 
                    creator of the game, but I created the randomizer since I greatly enjoyed it and wanted to add some extra replayability!
                    The randomizer randomly changes (thus the name "randomizer") a variety of features throughout the game per the user's 
                    selections, and iteratively modifies the game's files to enact these changes. As of right now the randomizer's fully 
                    functional (though a bit buggy), but is pending further changes as Absolution's development continues. You can check out
                    the randomizer <a href="https://github.com/khammen/Absolution-Randomizer" target="_blank">here</a>, and the game
